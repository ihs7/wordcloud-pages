# Privacy Policy

InsightViz strives to build quality software while rigorously safeguarding the privacy of our users and their data. This policy outlines our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage such personal information.

This policy was last updated on 14 January 2023.

## Information we collect

Our apps are built using Atlassian's Forge developer platform and collect as little information as possible, since they are run on Atlassian's infrastructure and do not communicate with external services. We have no automated access to logs, analytics, or other personal information generated as part of your usage of our products.

The information that we collect is limited to data that you voluntarily provide to us (for example, logs sent via email) and any information provided to us by Atlassian regarding the installation contexts of our Marketplace apps.

## Reasons for collection

We only collect and use your personal information when we have a legitimate reason for doing so. Examples of such legitimate reasons are replying to a support enquiry, or reaching out to share information.

## How long we keep your personal information

We retain your personal information only for as long as we need it to fulfil requirements explained in this policy. When it is no longer required we will ensure that it is securely deleted.

## Transfers of personal information

Personal information is only transferred internationally when the data is provided to us voluntarily (for example, when contacting our support) or for user uses explained in this policy. In these instances the personal information will reside in the jurisdiction of the corresponding Service Provider.

## Service Providers

We make use of no service providers that may have access to personal information.

## Security of your personal information

All personal information collected and retained is protected by commercially acceptable means to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, or modification. This includes electronic and physical security mechanisms as well as organizational requirements.

## Children’s privacy

Our apps are not aimed at anyone under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.

## Your rights

You are entitled to access, and request modification or erasure of any personal information that we have collected and retained. This can be done by contacting the Data Protection Officer below.

## Changes to this policy

At our discretion, we may change our privacy policy to reflect updates to our business operations or legislative or regulatory changes. If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page.
If required by law or regulations, we will get your permission or give you the opportunity to opt in to or opt out from, any new uses of your personal information.
